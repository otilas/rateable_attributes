= MakeRateable

MakeRateable is a re-implementation of ActsAsRateable for multiple attribute support.

== Usage

=== Preparation

In order to create the rating table just run the following command:
  
  script/generate make_rateable
  
This will generate a migration. Run rake db:migrate.

=== In the model
  
  make_rateable :attributes => [:graphics, :sound, :whatever]
  
This allows you to rate the model for the attributes graphics, sound and whatever.
To do so use

  my_model.rate(3, a_user[, :the_attribute]) # you can just ignore the attribute to create a general rating
  my_model.rate_graphics(3, a_user) # equals my_model.rate(3, a_user, :graphics)
